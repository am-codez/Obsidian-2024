- Corporation has options to move operations to lower taxation countries
- Traditional business:
    - Profit important but not main purpose
    - Company insecurity results in convincing you to want a product you don’t need (e.g. coca cola)
        - Large % profit (e.g. 25) spent yearly on marketing
        - Seeded too much power to private sector (e.g. Nestle cleaning water)
        - Amazon doesn’t care what you buy, just buy anything so they don’t need to advertise
- Phillips: doesn’t sell bulbs to institutions, sells service of light
    - Pros:
        - Industry-decided lightbulb lifespan but incentive to create more long-lasting bulbs
        - Lights that are only on when they need to be
        - Create more efficient, recycable bulbs
        - Don’t oversell bulbs so there’s less waste
    - Cons
        - Increased cost hiring experienced technicians for planning
        - High costs breaking contract
        - Delayed mantenance service and outsourcing issues
            
- Circular economy
    - Recycling is the last resort as we want to keep product (e.g. a shoe, bulb) as long as possible
- Dematerialization
    - Using less to produce more (e.g only need a smart phone as a calculator, phone, ect)
- Decouple growth from impact (e.g. Philights Signify, Adidas using sea plastic)

- Birth rate decline
    - People having less children as child/infant/mother mortality decreasing
    - Women joining workforce
- Elderly require a lot of care, expect pension, and don’t pay taxes
- China reversed stance on birth policy
    - Economy grew as a result of high workforce population availability
- Musk: societies shrinking so less geniuses and innovators born

- Sustainability talks can be rhetorical “How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?” and might be best described as should be better in the future than they are at present
	- Like other ethical concepts such as fairness or justice, sustainability is best interpreted conceptually rather than technically
- Sustainability is everyone wants to be a ceo but it’s position an context-base, e.g. quality assurnce ensures product up to standard, ceo thinks of if company should be making a product
- ![[Pasted image 20240911194130.png]]
- Climate risk is investment risk (e.g. Blackrock can’t make money in future if environment affecting supply chain)
- ESG value goes down if company is sued
- Peak Greta Thunberg in fall 2019
- Policy action can follow social action

- Tesla has multiple lawsuits so delisted from Dow-Jones Sustainability Index, but exxon mobile added because they have good public/employee relations
    
- Incentives for businesses adopting sustainable practices
    - Customers don’t want to associate with bad companies
    - Value-alignment for customers and talent
    - Attracting and maintaining talent desiring good management with fair practices
    - Available tax credits (tax reform) and incentives (subsidy removal) for more sustainable practices
    - More sustainable supply chain means future-proofind profits
    - Efficiency – cheaper packaging, installing solar panels on a warehouse, changing Kirkland packaging to reduce need for shipping packaging (reduces fuel costs because more milk fits in the truck), etc
    - Avoid boycotting, protests, social media based environmental campaigns
    - Government emission standards, as well as bans and requirements if alternatives exist (best available tech)
    - Governments can create markets to “cap and trade” certain emissions (like carbon), where companies receive a certain quota to pollute, which reduces over time
    - Governments imposing ecotaxes on environmentally-impactful products
    - More informed customers choosing sustainable products
        - Product labelling could inform customers choosing more sustainable products
        - Energy star high efficiency awards and recognition
        - Information campaigns
        
- Similar to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, need to know who you’re dealing with and what’s important to them
    
- Mayor would impact quality of life than prime minister would, e.g.
    - Remediating industrial land and converting it to residences and offices isn’t going to save the planet, but it can help people, cities, and migratory birds
        
- Red flags: “green”
- Buy one product and they give one away
    
- Consumer spending
    - More suspicious consumers (green hushing more popular now instead of n your face green-washing)
    - Consumers don’t want to pay more for green products
        
- Investor trust:
    - Apple isn’t an advertising firm like Google
    - Investors will invest in companies they trust who will innovate

- Complete analysis  
	- Choice to maintain morals or employment 
		- E.g. price fixing because manager asks 
	- Vaccine mandates for UBC students to attend class
		- "My body my choice" seems context specific
		- UBC's consequences, outcomes, and goals/values should be considered

- Anchoring Trap 
	- When considering a decision, the mind gives disproportionate weight to the first information it receives. 
	- Initial impressions, estimates, or data anchor subsequent thoughts and judgements. 
	- Anchors can be: 
		- Simple – a comment offered by a colleague or a statistic you saw on LinkedIn 
		- Insidious – stereotyping based on race, accent, dress, etc. 
	- In business the most common type is best events or trends. 
	- For example, projecting sales based simply on previous performance. 
	- Strategies for mitigating the trap might include… 
		- View the problem from different perspectives: use different starting points rather than the first line of thought that occurs to you. 
		- Think about the problem alone before consulting others (they will bias you). 
		- Be careful to avoid anchoring others. 
		- Be particularly careful in any kind of negotiation. 
- Status Quo Trap
	- Breaking from the status quo requires action, and when we take action, we take responsibility, thus opening ourselves to criticism and regret. 
	- Sins of commission (doing something) tend to be punished much more severely than sins of omission (doing nothing). Thus the status quo holds a particularly strong attraction. 
	- Strategies for mitigating the trap might include… 
		- Always remind yourself of objectives and examine how they would be served by the status quo. Never think of the status quo as your only alternative. 
		- Avoid exaggerating the costs of switching.
		- Ask yourself if you would chose the status quo if it weren’t the status quo. 
- Sunk Cost Trap
	- We make choices in a way that justifies past decisions. 
	- We throw good money after bad, doubling down on strategies or decisions or costs that are now irrecoverable. 
	- Why is it so hard to break this behavior? 
	- Because we are afraid to admit mistakes. 
		- For example - if you fire a poor performer that you hired, you are admitting that you made a bad hire. 
		- In banking: lenders often continue to lend to existing clients who are struggling in the hopes that they will recover.
	- Strategies for mitigating the trap might include… 
		- Acknowledge that some good ideas will end in failure: cut your loses rather than let them mount. Seek out and listen to the views of those who were uninvolved in the decision. 
		- Reassign responsibilities when necessary. 
		- Cultivate a culture that does not fear failure. 
- Confirming Evidence Trap
	- We seek out information that supports our existing instincts or points or view while avoiding information that contradicts. 
	- Two psychological forces at work: 
		- We subconsciously decide what we want to do before we figure out why we want to do it
		- We are more engaged by things we like than by things we dislike
	- Strategies for mitigating the trap might include… 
		- Always check to see if you are examine all the evidence with equal rigor. 
		- Find a devil’s advocate (yourself or someone you respect). 
	- Be honest with yourself about your motives. Are you gathering information to help you make a smart choice, or evidence confirming what you’d like to do? In seeking advice from others, don’t ask leading questions. 
- Framing Trap
	- The way a decision is framed can profoundly influence the choices you make. 
	- A frame can introduce the status quo or an anchor. 
	- Two types of frames: 
		- Frames as gains versus losses 
		- Frames with different reference points
	- Strategies for mitigating the trap might include… 
		- Don’t automatically accept the initial frame, whether it was formulated by you or by someone else. 
		- Pose problems in a neutral, redundant way that combines gains and losses or embraces different reference points. 
	- Would you accept a fifty-fifty chance of either losing $300, resulting in a bank balance of $1,700, or winning $500, resulting in a bank balance of $2,500?
- Overconfidence Trap
	- “Even though most of us are not very good at making estimates or forecasts, we actually tend to be over confident about our accuracy. That can lead to errors in judgment and, in turn, bad decisions.” 
	- “If managers underestimate the high end or over estimate the low end of a crucial variable, they may miss attractive opportunities or expose themselves to far greater risk than they realize.”
- Prudence Trap
	- “When faced with high-stakes decisions, we tend to adjust our estimates or forecasts “just to be on the safe side.” 
	- An extreme example is the methodology of “worst-case analysis,” which was once popular in the design of weapons systems and is still used in certain engineering and regulatory settings. Worst-case analysis added enormous costs with no practical benefit (in fact, it often backfired by touching off an arms race), proving that too much prudence can sometimes be as dangerous as too little.
- Recallability Trap
	- “We frequently base our predictions about future events on our memory of past events, we can be overly influenced by dramatic events—those that leave a strong impression on our memory.” “We all, for example, exaggerate the probability of rare but catastrophic occurrences such as plane crashes because they get disproportionate attention in the media.” “You will assign a higher probability to traffic accidents if you have passed one on the way to work.”
	- “When it comes to business decisions, there’s rarely such a thing as a no-brainer. Our brains are always at work, sometimes, unfortunately, in ways that hinder rather than help us. The traps we’ve reviewed can all work in isolation. But, even more dangerous, they can work in concert, amplifying one another.”
	
- Scientists are accustomed to deductive reasoning. It produces extremely reliable results.  But it requires careful experimental design and lots of data.  
- When it comes to complex questions with lots of uncertainty, inductive reasoning is advantageous.

- Start with a complex problem
	- Create a mindmap of ideas
	- Look for patterns 
	- Break things into MEC (mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive)
