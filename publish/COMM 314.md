- Corporation has options to move operations to lower taxation countries
- Traditional business:
    - Profit important but not main purpose
    - Company insecurity results in convincing you to want a product you don’t need (e.g. coca cola)
        - Large % profit (e.g. 25) spent yearly on marketing
        - Seeded too much power to private sector (e.g. Nestle cleaning water)
        - Amazon doesn’t care what you buy, just buy anything so they don’t need to advertise
- Phillips: doesn’t sell bulbs to institutions, sells service of light
    - Pros:
        - Industry-decided lightbulb lifespan but incentive to create more long-lasting bulbs
        - Lights that are only on when they need to be
        - Create more efficient, recycable bulbs
        - Don’t oversell bulbs so there’s less waste
    - Cons
        - Increased cost hiring experienced technicians for planning
        - High costs breaking contract
        - Delayed mantenance service and outsourcing issues
            
- Circular economy
    - Recycling is the last resort as we want to keep product (e.g. a shoe, bulb) as long as possible
- Dematerialization
    - Using less to produce more (e.g only need a smart phone as a calculator, phone, ect)
- Decouple growth from impact (e.g. Philights Signify, Adidas using sea plastic)

- Birth rate decline
    - People having less children as child/infant/mother mortality decreasing
    - Women joining workforce
- Elderly require a lot of care, expect pension, and don’t pay taxes
- China reversed stance on birth policy
    - Economy grew as a result of high workforce population availability
- Musk: societies shrinking so less geniuses and innovators born

- Sustainability talks can be rhetorical “How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?” and might be best described as should be better in the future than they are at present
	- Like other ethical concepts such as fairness or justice, sustainability is best interpreted conceptually rather than technically
- Sustainability is everyone wants to be a ceo but it’s position an context-base, e.g. quality assurnce ensures product up to standard, ceo thinks of if company should be making a product
- ![[Pasted image 20240911194130.png]]
- Climate risk is investment risk (e.g. Blackrock can’t make money in future if environment affecting supply chain)
- ESG value goes down if company is sued
- Peak Greta Thunberg in fall 2019
- Policy action can follow social action

- Tesla has multiple lawsuits so delisted from Dow-Jones Sustainability Index, but exxon mobile added because they have good public/employee relations
    
- Incentives for businesses adopting sustainable practices
    - Customers don’t want to associate with bad companies
    - Value-alignment for customers and talent
    - Attracting and maintaining talent desiring good management with fair practices
    - Available tax credits (tax reform) and incentives (subsidy removal) for more sustainable practices
    - More sustainable supply chain means future-proofind profits
    - Efficiency – cheaper packaging, installing solar panels on a warehouse, changing Kirkland packaging to reduce need for shipping packaging (reduces fuel costs because more milk fits in the truck), etc
    - Avoid boycotting, protests, social media based environmental campaigns
    - Government emission standards, as well as bans and requirements if alternatives exist (best available tech)
    - Governments can create markets to “cap and trade” certain emissions (like carbon), where companies receive a certain quota to pollute, which reduces over time
    - Governments imposing ecotaxes on environmentally-impactful products
    - More informed customers choosing sustainable products
        - Product labelling could inform customers choosing more sustainable products
        - Energy star high efficiency awards and recognition
        - Information campaigns
        
- Similar to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, need to know who you’re dealing with and what’s important to them
    
- Mayor would impact quality of life than prime minister would, e.g.
    - Remediating industrial land and converting it to residences and offices isn’t going to save the planet, but it can help people, cities, and migratory birds
        
- Red flags: “green”
- Buy one product and they give one away
    
- Consumer spending
    - More suspicious consumers (green hushing more popular now instead of n your face green-washing)
    - Consumers don’t want to pay more for green products
        
- Investor trust:
    - Apple isn’t an advertising firm like Google
    - Investors will invest in companies they trust who will innovate

- Complete analysis  
	- Choice to maintain morals or employment 
		- E.g. price fixing because manager asks 
	- Vaccine mandates for UBC students to attend class
		- "My body my choice" seems context specific
		- UBC's consequences, outcomes, and goals/values should be considered

- Anchoring trap: biased by first fact you learn about a topic
	- E.g. one person has idea for topic and is vocal about it, so people latch onto it
- Status quo trap: we tend to work within constrains, first person to suggest going against status quo in sea of people going along with things (e.g. omission sin)
	- Presenting status quo is an option important, not just change
	- UI has become much less intuitive but we have (skew-morphic design)
- Sunk cost trap: recognising when idea was a bad one 
	- People don't like to admit mistake 
- Confirming evidence trap: we are engaged by information that supports our existing instincts or POV and avoid information that contradicts
	- Find devil's advocate (authentic) not playing the role 
	- Be honest about motivates - are you gathering info to make smart choice or confirm evidence of what you want to do 
- Framing trap: "would you like to win $100 or lose $100?" vs "would you like to lose $100 or lose $100"
	- Should pose problem in a neutral, redundant way
- Overconfidence trap: something goes well once so we get too confident doing it next time so we might not do well if problem w
- Prudence trap: over-engineer a product until perfect instead of getting not perfect out and improving it later
- Recallability trap: 
- Inductive reasoning
