- COGS is an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to understanding and designing systems that think and act intelligently
- “Intelligence” varies by perspective – science (gradient), philosophy (all or none)
- AI is “fake, artificial” intelligence but not all artificial things are fake
    - Fake artificial - hercamer vs real artificial - lab created diamonds
    - Not all fake things are artificially created (e.g. fool’s gold)
    - Natural artificial – spex wasp (follows algorithm without any adaptability to setting)
- AI’s intelligence can be real artifical intelligence, if achieved


- Linguistic definitions, with example of word (“the”):    
    - Phonetics: how we make/comprehend possible speech sounds or sign parameters
    - Phonology: which possible speech sounds/sign parameters your language uses, and how they pattern
        - Pronounciation changes depending on word preceeding it
    - Morphology: how words/signs are formed
    - Syntax: how sentences are formed
        - Can only occur before nouns and can be substituted by a small numner of words (determiners, e.g. “a”, “this”, “my”)
    - Semantics: how meaning derives from words/signs and sentences
        - “The” is a definite determiner, the meaning of a noun phrase it is used in (e.g., “the book”) can only be determined by the specific discourse situation it is used in (e.g., “The book I lost yesterday was found by my roommate”)
        - The meaning of definite noun phrases like “the book” will shift from book to book and from situation to situation
    - Pragmatics: how meaning derives from context
        
- Subfields:
    - Neurolinguistics and Psycholinguistics: How language is stored and processed by the brain/mind
        - When people hear a definite noun phrase like “the book”, it sets off a search for a current perceptual input and of memory for an object with the current properties
        - If no appropriate object is found, the hearer tries to deduce one
    - Sociolinguistics: Language in society (for instance, regional dialects)
    - The relationship between Language and Culture
    - Historical Linguistics: how languages change over time
    - Computational Linguistics - the study of how computers can process human language
        - AI researchers exploit properties of the word “the” when they build programs that can understand natural language
            
- Language is communication but not vise versa (e.g. traffic light – limited)
- Communication: A signal is transmitted from a sender to a receiver (or group of receivers) along a channel of communication. The signal will have a particular form and will convey a particular meaning (or message). The connection between form and meaning constitutes a code
    - sender/source (light)
    - message (stop/go)
    - channel (colour)
    - receiver/distinuation (human gaze)
    - effect (human stops/goes)
        
- Language: missing one feature means it’s communication, not language
    - A dedicated communicative channel (e.g., vocal-auditory for spoken languages, manual visual for sign languages)
    - Broadcast transmission & directional reception
    - Rapid fading (transitoriness)
    - Interchangeability
    - Total feedback
    - Specialization
    - Semanticity
        
- Human language: fundamental property of human cognition 
    - Arbitrariness
        - Iconicity: word or sign looks like what it means (e.g. drink in ASL or gulp in English)
        - Arbitrariness: word meaning arbitrary but agreed on (e.g. table)
    - Discreteness
    - Productivity
    - Duality of patterning
    - Cultural transmission
    - Learnability
    - Displacement
        - Referring to events remote in space, time, or reality
    - Prevarication
    - Reflexiveness
- Animal communication:
    - Innate (e.g. barking)
        - One exception, song birds: will still try as communication style is innate but will only come up with broken version for its species
    - Fixed repertoire of signals
    - About here and now
        - One exception is bees: not what if or discussing past events, but can communicate forms of displacement (space)

-   Hockett describes design-feature #5 “total feedback”  
	- “The speaker of a language hears, by total feedback, everything of linguistic relevance in what he himself says”  
	- Important, since it makes possible the so-called internalization of   communicative behavior that constitutes at least a major portion of  “thinking”
- Key feature of language is its ability to represent the world, to say how things are, and to say that they are a certain way even when they are not that way (to misrepresent the world)
- We ask questions, make demands, express emotions, so, language is much more than just a representational system - it's part of a system that generates the ideas that can be communicated in language
- Two movements in contemporary western philosophy:  
	- Analytic (English-speaking)  
	- Phenomenological (German/French)
- Challenges:
	- Considerable disagreement even among contemporary analytic philosophers about what philosophy is or should be
		- Metaphilosophy, a journal  
		- Michael Dummett (2001) The Nature and Future of Philosophy  
		- Timothy Williamson (2008) The Philosophy of Philosophy
	- Many scientific disciplines (chemistry, anthropology, ...), unlike Philosophy, have a settled body of knowledge that must be mastered in order to gain entry to the field, as nearly everything is contested
	- Philosophy is the tradition of inquiry and major figures and their works, where we find the disciplinary culture, standards of adequacy, methods, and the sense of what is interesting
- Philosophical naturalism
	- Stages:
		- Before questions are clear enough to apply scientific methods to them (i.e. occurs prior to science)
		- Reflects on the progress of science: questions of meaning (conceptual questions) and justification (methodological questions)
- Free Will
	- Traditional
		- Computers can never be intelligent or have agency because they can't act freely (unpredictably), they make decisions based on instructions
	- Contemporary
		- Consider the difference between “on purpose” and “by accident”
		- Consider the difference between something you do and something that happens to you
- Turning Test (1950)
	- Two controversies:
		- Empirical: will there ever be an actual computer that can win the imitation game?  
		- Conceptual: if a computer does win the game, does that mean (or provide good evidence that) it can think
	- Responses:
		- Turing: says yes to both 
			- Believes that within 50 years, computers will be able to convincingly imitate humans in a game to the point where an interrogator would only have a 70% chance of correctly identifying the machine after five minutes
			- Considers the question "Can machines think?" to be meaningless, but predicts that by the end of the century, the concept of machines thinking will be widely accepted due to changes in language and educated opinion
		- Descartes: says no to 1 but yes to 2
			- Two key tests to distinguish a machine from a human, even if the machine resembles humans and mimics their actions: the first test is the machine's inability to arrange words or signs in a manner that effectively expresses thoughts, like a human can; the machine might produce sounds, but it won't be able to respond appropriately to conversation
		- Searle (Chinese Room): says no to 2
			- Seems as though he (as the computer) understands a Chinese language, but he's using a rule book and doesn't realize what he's reading, saying, or even speaking to anyone else
		- There are a variety of positions one can take on the Chinese Room thought experiment:  
			- It fails to demonstrate that AI is impossible (Levesque 2009 “Is It Enough to Get the Behaviour Right?)  
			- It demonstrates that all forms of AI are impossible (Searle 1986 Minds, Brains, and Science)  
			- It demonstrates that AI is impossible, if one takes the classic “symbols and search” approach: GOFAI
				- Therefore, AI should take another (NFAI) approach: either the machine learning, artificial neural network approach or the embodied, enactive cognition approach (Clarke 2014 Mindware)
- The Mind
	- Dualism  
		- Minds (the mental) and bodies (the physical) are distinct from one another, although they are in causal contact
	- Behaviourism  
		- Talk that purports to be about minds is really talk about behaviour patterns  
	- Identity Theory  
		- Minds are brains, and thoughts are brain states or processes
	- Functionalism  
		- Whatever does a mind’s job (role or function) is a mind, no matter what it’s made of, or how it does this
