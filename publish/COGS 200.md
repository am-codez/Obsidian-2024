### Five cognitive science disciplines and "the"
1. Linguistics 
	- Phonetics: how we make/comprehend possible speech sounds or sign parameters
		- Physical articulation of the word "the" 
	- Phonology: which possible speech sounds/sign parameters your language uses, and how they pattern
		- Pronunciation changes depending on word preceding it
		- Mental articulation of the word "the" 
	- Morphology: how words/signs are formed
	- Syntax: how sentences are formed
		- Can only occur before nouns and can be substituted by a small number of words (determiners, e.g. “a”, “this”, “my”)
	- Semantics: how meaning derives from words/signs and sentences
		- “The” is a definite determiner, the meaning of a noun phrase it is used in (e.g., “the book”) can only be determined by the specific discourse situation it is used in
			- E.g. “The book I lost yesterday was found by my roommate”
	- Pragmatics: how meaning derives from context
2. Psychology
    - Neurolinguistics and Psycholinguistics: How language is stored and processed by the brain/mind
        - When people hear a definite noun phrase like “the book”, it sets off a search for a current perceptual input and of memory for an object with the current properties
    - Sociolinguistics: Language in society (for instance, regional dialects)
    - The relationship between Language and Culture
    - Historical Linguistics: how languages change over time
3. Neuroscience
	- Certain brain regions are dedicated to semantic and syntactic processing of “the” and other function words (words involved in determining grammatical structure)
	- E.g. Broca’s area is involved in assigning structure to sentences, so damage to this area results in disrupted sentence structure (Broca's aphasia)
4. Computer Science
	- Computational Linguistics - the study of how computers can process human language
	- AI researchers exploit properties of the word “the” when they build programs that can understand natural language
		- E.g. The parser is a natural language processing program that figures out grammatical properties of incoming sentences

### Language and Communication
- Communication: A signal, with a particular form and meaning/message, is transmitted from a sender to receiver(s) along a channel of communication
	- The connection between form and meaning constitutes a code
- Language is communication but not vise versa
	- We ask questions, make demands, express emotions, so, language is much more than just a representational system 
	- It's part of a system that generates the ideas that can be communicated in language

- Salzmann's Model for Communication
	- Includes:
		- Sender/source 
		- Message 
		- Channel 
		- Receiver/destination 
		- Effect
	- E.g. Traffic light
	    - sender/source (light)
	    - message (stop/go)
	    - channel (colour)
	    - receiver (human gaze)
	    - effect (human stops/goes)
        
- Hockett's Design Features for Language
	- Missing one feature means it’s communication
	- Human Language includes:
	    1. A dedicated communicative channel (e.g., vocal-auditory for spoken languages, manual visual for sign languages)
	    2. Broadcast transmission & directional reception
	    3. Rapid fading (transistorises)
	    4. Interchangeability
	    5. Total feedback
		    - When someone speaks a language, they are fully aware of the sounds and meanings of what they are saying, and they can hear and process every aspect of their speech, allowing them to adjust based on their own auditory experience
		    - Important because this helps us internalise communication patterns crucial for organising thinking and communicating effectively 
	    6. Specialization
		    - Unrelated to  biological function (e.g. panting)
	    7. Semanticity
		    - Specific sound signals are directly tied to certain meanings
		8. Arbitrariness
			- Word meaning arbitrary but agreed on, e.g. table
			- Contrast with iconicity where a word or sign looks like what it means, E.g. drink in ASL, gulp in English
	    9. Discreteness
			- Language can be broken down into distinct, smaller units, such as sounds (phonemes), words (morphemes), or phrases
	    10. Productivity/Creativity
		    - Using finite set of discrete units, language users create and understand an infinite number of new utterances (e.g. words and sentences)
		    - E.g. yeet, tip-flation
	    11. Duality of patterning
		    - Language is composed of basic meaningless units (vowel sounds) to form larger units (words) that have arbitrary meaning 
	    12. Cultural transmission
			- Learned after birth, in a social setting 
	    13. Learnability
			- Speaker can learn the language, or even multiple languages
	    14. Displacement
		    - Referring to events remote in space, time, or reality
		    - E.g. It's raining in New York right now 
		    - E.g. Tom will eat eggs tomorow 
	    15. Prevarication
			- Ability to lie or deceive
	    16. Reflexiveness
			- Ability to discuss the idea and structure of language with others

- Animal communication:
    - Mostly innate (e.g. barking)
        - One exception, song birds: will still try as communication style is innate but will only come up with broken version for its species
    - Limit extent 
    - Fixed repertoire of signals
    - About here and now
        - One exception is bees: not what if or discussing past events, but can communicate forms of displacement (space)

### Philosophy as a Discipline
- COGS is an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to understanding and designing systems that think and act intelligently

- Two movements in contemporary western philosophy:  
	- Analytic (English-speaking)  
	- Phenomenological (German/French)
- Challenges:
	- Considerable disagreement even among contemporary analytic philosophers about what philosophy is or should be
	- Philosophy is not concerned with direct observations or facts (first order), but with understanding how we think about those facts (second-order)
	- This leads to the perception of philosophy as elusive and lacking concrete progress, as it seeks clarity rather than practical applications
	- Philosophy serves as a foundation for various scientific disciplines, arising from the fundamental human impulse of wonder
	- Philosophers rely on a shared historical context to engage with and critique each other's ideas, forming a distinct intellectual lineage
	
- Philosophical naturalism
	- Philosophy as a second-order discipline, the study of the various first-order activities of scientists, artists, theologians, jurists 
	- Stages:
		- Before questions are clear enough to apply scientific methods to them 
		- Reflects on the progress of science: questions of meaning (conceptual questions) and justification (methodological questions)
		
### Free Will
- Traditional
	- Computers can never be intelligent or have agency because they can't act freely (unpredictably), they make decisions based on instructions
		- Even adding a "random" primitive does not mean that the computer is acting freely 
- Contemporary
	- Consider the difference between “on purpose” and “by accident”
	- Consider the difference between something you do and something that happens to you

### Cognitive Systems
- COGS covers:
	- Natural cognitive systems like humans, other animals, other living organisms, social groups  
	- Artificial cognitive systems like computers, robots, programs, models  
- A system is something like a creature or a mechanism or an organised   network or structure that is distinct from its environment and made up of interrelated and interacting parts
- A system is cognitive if:
	- It can think (process information) and act on what it thinks 
	- Someone (or something) exhibits behaviour that is understandable in terms of what it is thinking.  
- We take an engineering or design perspective on cognitive systems, since our interests include artificial systems

### Intelligence and the Turning Test (1950)
- “Intelligence” varies by perspective – science (gradient), philosophy (all or none)
- Two controversies:
		- Empirical: will there ever be an actual computer that can win the imitation game?
		- Conceptual: if a computer does win the game, does that mean it can think?
	
- Responses:
	- Turing: says yes to both 
		- Believes that within 50 years, computers will be able to convincingly imitate humans in a game to the point where an interrogator would only have a 70% chance of correctly identifying the machine after 5 minutes
		- Considers the question "Can machines think?" to be meaningless, but predicts that by the end of the century, the concept of machines thinking will be widely accepted due to changes in language and educated opinion
	- Descartes: says no to 1 but yes to 2
		- Two key tests to distinguish a machine from a human: 
			- The machine's inability to arrange words or signs in a manner that effectively expresses human-like thoughts
			- The machine might produce sounds, but it won't be able to respond appropriately to conversation
	- Searle (Chinese Room): says no to 2
		- Seems as though he (as the computer) understands a Chinese language, but he's only obeying a rule book and doesn't realise what he's reading, saying, or even speaking
- There are a variety of positions one can take on the Chinese Room thought experiment:  
	- It fails to demonstrate that AI is impossible (Levesque)  
	- It demonstrates that all forms of AI are impossible (Searle)  
	- It demonstrates that AI is impossible, if one takes the classic “symbols and search” approach: GOFAI
- Supported by Functionalism and Behaviourism 

### The Mind
1. Dualism  
	- Minds (the mental) and bodies (the physical) are distinct from one another, although they are in causal contact
	- Endorsed by many religions 
	- Highlights the fact that:
		- Each of us has special access to the contents of her own mind
		- Mental experiences (thoughts, feelings) exist independent of physical actions or sensory perceptions, suggesting that inner experiences have a direct, stable relationship to external realities
		- Internal aspects of consciousness only required for a full "mental life"
	- Arguments again (Wittgenstein):
		- If everyone has a different "beetle," then the concept of "beetle" loses its meaning as a shared term in language
			- Therefore, if inner experiences are purely subjective and cannot be communicated or compared, then the framework of dualism—where mental states can be treated as distinct entities alongside physical states—becomes problematic
			  
2. Behaviourism  
	- Advocates for a scientific study of the mind that relies on observable behaviour rather than introspection or subjective reports 
	- Considered scientifically valid, as it emphasizes objective and measurable evidence
		- E.g. if someone claims to feel happy, this should be demonstrated through observable actions (like smiling)
	- Endorses the Turing Test as a criterion for determining intelligence, so that if a machine behaves in a way that is functionally equivalent to human behaviour, it can be considered intelligent, regardless of its internal processes
	- Arguments against:
		- Treats mental states (e.g. feelings, introspection) as entirely external, neglecting the internal aspects of the mind 
		- Discrepancy between mental state and outward behaviour
			- E.g. is someone really in pain if they aren't crying?
			  
3. Identity Theory  
	- Advocates that minds are brains, and thoughts are specific physical brain states or processes
		-  E.g. When you touch your hand to a hot stove, your feeling of pain just is firing c-fibers
	- Considered scientifically valid and stands in contrast to dualism
	- Arguments against:
		- Restricts application of "intelligence" to creatures with a brain
		  
4. Functionalism  
	- Advocates that while thoughts and behaviours are distinct, they are inter-connected
	- Intelligence is defined by cognitive functions a system performs, rather than its material composition 
	- Computers exhibit cognitive functions and mental processes similar to brains (e.g. memory, learning, etc)
	- Middle ground between Dualism and Behaviourism, distinguishing thought from behaviour while linking them through observable action 

### AI and Cognitive Systems 
- AI approach to Cognitive Systems provides tools to build intelligent agents rather than only studying the external behaviour of natural agents or dissecting their inner workings
- Intelligent in narrow domains 
- Considered a cognitive (intelligent) system if it possess the following:
	- Perception
	- Memory
	- Learning
	- Reasoning
	- Goal-directed behaviour

- AI proposed definitions:
	- Systems that think like humans 
		- Model the cognitive functions and behaviours of humans 
		- Objections: measuring thought would mean spending time studying how minds operate (e.g IQ tests) rather than thinking about what intelligence could mean in various domains
	- Systems that act like humans 
		- Turing test - "Imitation Game"
		- Definition of intelligent (verbal) behaviour
		- Objections: mumans often act intelligently 
	- Systems that think rationally
		- Rationality is an abstract ideal of intelligence, as it's the ability to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge rather than “whatever humans think/do”
		- Syllogisms: argument structures that always yield correct conclusions given correct premises
			- Led to logic and probabilistic reasoning which are used heavily in AI
		- Objections: reasoning is useless without action 
	- Systems that act rationally 
		- Rationality is more cleanly defined than human behaviour, so it's a better design objective
		- It's easier to define rational action than rational thought

- AI is “fake, artificial” intelligence but not all artificial things are fake
    - Fake artificial - hercamer diamonds 
    - Real artificial - lab created diamonds
	    - Not all fake things are artificially created (e.g. fool’s gold)
    - Natural artificial – spex wasp 
	    - Follows algorithm without any adaptability to setting
- AI’s intelligence can be real artificial intelligence, if achieved
	- Artificial 1: real artificial 
	- Artificial 2: fake artificial: not possible because if an agent acts intelligently, it is intelligent 

### AI Goals 
- Scientific goal: to understand the principles that make intelligent behaviour possible in natural or artificial systems
	- Analyze natural and artificial agents
	- Formulate and test hypotheses about what it takes to construct intelligent agents
	- Design, build, and experiment with computational systems that perform tasks that require intelligence
- Engineering goal: design useful, intelligent artifacts

- AI aims to build intelligent agents that act rationally in their environments
	- Proactive - they act appropriately given goals and circumstances
	- Reactive - they are flexible to changing environments and goals
	- They learn from experience
		- Agent learning how the world works based on experience, beginning with no prior knowledge
		- Differs from the agent receiving a model of the world as training
	- They make appropriate choices given perceptual and computational limitations
	- Dropping the constrains of human cognition as a requirement for intelligence 
- Poker is a zero-sum, multi-person game with chance and imperfect information – closer to reality

### AI Types
- Human-Centered AI creates AI systems that augment rather than displace humans
- Human-Compatible AI develops controllable AI aligned with human preferences

- Generative AI
	- GPT-4
		- A Large Language Model (LLM), given text as context, predicts most likely next word then repeats that process to generate arbitrarily long texts (essays, programs, contracts, scripts, emails
		- GPT-4 is a deep architecture 1.8 trillion parameters, across 120 layers trained on gigantic text and code datasets
		- ChatGPT trained to use GPT-4 by humans on sample dialog, to make it sound like a human and use human feedback to correspond to human preference
	- Other for Fitness, Healthcare, Education, etc
	- Risks:
		- Trained on the Internet (fake info, hate speech)
		- Bias in data reproduced in output
		- Hallucinating answers
		- Predicting words with no concept of truth 
		- Massive energy and resource consumption 
		- Eroded trust 
		- Deep fakes and email scams 
		- Copyright infringement  
-  Classification AI

- No current Artificial General Intelligence
	- Whereby agent could learn to accomplish any task a human can

### Reception of AI
- Impact on employment
	- Rapid shift in jobs and skills
	- Some skills done by AI now (with more to come), thus we must upgrade skills and learn to exploit AI to keep up 
	- Many jobs disappearing (e.g. bank tellers, travel agents, etc)
	- Fewer needed to create wealth, thus worsening wealth inequality - UBI?
	
- MetaAI tribes
	- Realists: 
		- Immediate harms and short term risks (discrimination, bias, misinformation, disinformation, deep fakes, manipulation, bullying and sexual harassment, copyright theft, worker exploitation, environmental harms) 
		- Need AI ethics, auditing, certification, licensing and regulation
	- Accelerationists: 
		- Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead! Only corporate self-regulation, Silicon Valley libertarians
	- Doomers
		- Long term risks (AGI, misalignment, out of control, existential, extinction, regulation and licensing, Effective Altruism)

- Are humans obsolete?
	- AI successes: science, deep learning, self-driving vehicles, drones, web agents, generative AI, chatbots, etc 
	- AI may be key for sustainability
	- Immediate concerns: fairness, trust, safety, regulation, mental health, etc
	- Massive employment shifts, precarious jobs, inequality, education, .etc
	- AI disrupts how we live, learn, work and play
	- Humans are no longer unique in the cognitive universe

### Psychological Study
- Two early approaches to Psychology
	- Structuralism (Wilhelm Wundt, Edward Tichener, Edwin Boring)  
		- An approach to psychology that attempted to isolate the basic unit (structure) of the mind  
		- Method: systematic introspection  
		- i.e., analysing your own subjective experience  
	- Functionalism (William James)  
		- An approach to psychology that emphasized the adaptive significances of mental processes
		- Mental states and intelligence increase the rate of survival  
		- Heavily influenced by Darwinian evolution
		
- Psychologists collectively study other people's minds
	- Assume the mind is scientifically intelligible 
	- Follow scientific method 
	- Don't introspect on their own mind 


### Methods for study the mind
Look at the minds of others - beliefs, judgements, sensory experiences, illusions, behaviour, etc
- E.g. Sight
	- Issue: Illumination falling on an object (brightness) and reflectance (light reflected back) vs stuff it's made of 
	- Solution as a feature: Lightness constancy (the ability to factor out changes in illumination, and thus sense the "real" lightness of material)
		- Drawbacks: can affect ability to perceive real colour and size depending on context
	- Thus, we don't see the world "as it is" (i.e. based on only pattern of light on our retinas), our brains construct a single experience of the world based on raw visual input (light) and our beliefs/expectations/context
- E.g. Communication 
	- Your brain has the ability to decode the sounds into thoughts, and through these sounds I can make different sounds to give you other thoughts  
	- Methods:
		- Tens of thousands of memorised words  
		- Grammatical rules that combine words into an infinite number of possible sentences, to allow communication novel ideas
		- Sentence structure determines meaning 

Look at atypical minds - TBI, atypical development, mental health
- E.g. Split-brain patients, Broca's aphasia

Look at minds of other species - rodents, birds, etc

### Information Processing 
- Humans are limited in how much information they can handle so, humans actively select information

- Information Processing Models
	- ![[Pasted image 20240924104542.png]]
		- Limited capacity in how much we can process 
		- We select for deeper processing (meaning) based on some primitive feature (e.g. location, pitch, colour)
		- E.g. Dichotic listening/shadowing task: information on the unattended channel seems to not be processed but intrusions can occur suggesting they do 
	- There are many models on how the flow of information through the cognitive system affects the relationships between different cognitive  processes  
		- Attention research is concerned with the relationship between the capacity limitations and the selective processes used to deal with those limitations
