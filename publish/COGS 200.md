- COGS is an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to understanding and designing systems that think and act intelligently
- “Intelligence” varies by perspective – science (gradient), philosophy (all or none)
- AI is “fake, artificial” intelligence but not all artificial things are fake
    - Fake artificial - hercamer vs real artificial - lab created diamonds
    - Not all fake things are artificially created (e.g. fool’s gold)
    - Natural artificial – spex wasp (follows algorithm without any adaptability to setting)
- AI’s intelligence can be real artifical intelligence, if achieved


- Linguistic definitions, with example of word (“the”):    
    - Phonetics: how we make/comprehend possible speech sounds or sign parameters
    - Phonology: which possible speech sounds/sign parameters your language uses, and how they pattern
        - Pronounciation changes depending on word preceeding it
    - Morphology: how words/signs are formed
    - Syntax: how sentences are formed
        - Can only occur before nouns and can be substituted by a small numner of words (determiners, e.g. “a”, “this”, “my”)
    - Semantics: how meaning derives from words/signs and sentences
        - “The” is a definite determiner, the meaning of a noun phrase it is used in (e.g., “the book”) can only be determined by the specific discourse situation it is used in (e.g., “The book I lost yesterday was found by my roommate”)
        - The meaning of definite noun phrases like “the book” will shift from book to book and from situation to situation
    - Pragmatics: how meaning derives from context
        
- Subfields:
    - Neurolinguistics and Psycholinguistics: How language is stored and processed by the brain/mind
        - When people hear a definite noun phrase like “the book”, it sets off a search for a current perceptual input and of memory for an object with the current properties
        - If no appropriate object is found, the hearer tries to deduce one
    - Sociolinguistics: Language in society (for instance, regional dialects)
    - The relationship between Language and Culture
    - Historical Linguistics: how languages change over time
    - Computational Linguistics - the study of how computers can process human language
        - AI researchers exploit properties of the word “the” when they build programs that can understand natural language
            
- Language is communication but not vise versa (e.g. traffic light – limited)
- Communication: A signal is transmitted from a sender to a receiver (or group of receivers) along a channel of communication. The signal will have a particular form and will convey a particular meaning (or message). The connection between form and meaning constitutes a code
    - sender/source (light)
    - message (stop/go)
    - channel (colour)
    - receiver/distinuation (human gaze)
    - effect (human stops/goes)
        
- Language: missing one feature means it’s communication, not language
    - A dedicated communicative channel (e.g., vocal-auditory for spoken languages, manual visual for sign languages)
    - Broadcast transmission & directional reception
    - Rapid fading (transitoriness)
    - Interchangeability
    - Total feedback
    - Specialization
    - Semanticity
        
- Human language:
    - Arbitrariness
        - Iconicity: word or sign looks like what it means (e.g. drink in ASL or gulp in English)
        - Arbitrariness: word meaning arbitrary but agreed on (e.g. table)
    - Discreteness
    - Productivity
    - Duality of patterning
    - Cultural transmission
    - Learnability
    - Displacement
        - Referring to events remote in space, time, or reality
    - Prevarication
    - Reflexiveness
- Animal communication:
    - Innate (e.g. barking)
        - One exception, song birds: will still try as communication style is innate but will only come up with broken version for its species
    - Fixed sepertoire of signals
    - About here and now
        - One exception is bees: not what if or discussing past events, but can communicate forms of displacement (space)
