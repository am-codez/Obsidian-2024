### Five cognitive science disciplines and "the"
- Linguistics 
	- Phonetics: how we make/comprehend possible speech sounds or sign parameters
		- Articulation of the word "the" sounds different before different words
	- Phonology: which possible speech sounds/sign parameters your language uses, and how they pattern
		- Pronunciation changes depending on word preceding it
	- Morphology: how words/signs are formed
	- Syntax: how sentences are formed
		- Can only occur before nouns and can be substituted by a small number of words (determiners, e.g. “a”, “this”, “my”)
	- Semantics: how meaning derives from words/signs and sentences
		- “The” is a definite determiner, the meaning of a noun phrase it is used in (e.g., “the book”) can only be determined by the specific discourse situation it is used in
			- E.g. “The book I lost yesterday was found by my roommate”
	- Pragmatics: how meaning derives from context
- Psychology
    - Neurolinguistics and Psycholinguistics: How language is stored and processed by the brain/mind
        - When people hear a definite noun phrase like “the book”, it sets off a search for a current perceptual input and of memory for an object with the current properties
    - Sociolinguistics: Language in society (for instance, regional dialects)
    - The relationship between Language and Culture
    - Historical Linguistics: how languages change over time
- Neuroscience
	- Certain brain regions are dedicated to semantic and syntactic processing of “the” and other function words (words involved in determining grammatical structure)
	- E.g. Broca’s area is involved in assigning structure to sentences, so damage to this area results in disrupted sentence structure (Broca's aphasia)
- Computer Science
	- Computational Linguistics - the study of how computers can process human language
	- AI researchers exploit properties of the word “the” when they build programs that can understand natural language
		- E.g. The parser is a natural language processing program that figures out grammatical properties of incoming sentences

(1) how language is relevant to the general study of cognition, and (2) what language is and what criteria (aka language design features) researchers use to identify a communication system to be a language. For example, I can either ask you to explain a certain design feature and/or give an example of it, or I can give you some fact from human or animal communication and ask which language design feature this fact exemplifies.
### Language and Communication
- Communication: A signal, with a particular form and meaning/message, is transmitted from a sender to receiver(s) along a channel of communication
	- The connection between form and meaning constitutes a code
- Language is communication but not vise versa (e.g. traffic light – limited)
	- E.g. Traffic light
	    - sender/source (light)
	    - message (stop/go)
	    - channel (colour)
	    - receiver/distinuation (human gaze)
	    - effect (human stops/goes)
        
- Language; missing one feature means it’s communication:
    - A dedicated communicative channel (e.g., vocal-auditory for spoken languages, manual visual for sign languages)
    - Broadcast transmission & directional reception
    - Rapid fading (transistorises)
    - Interchangeability
    - Total feedback
    - Specialization
    - Semanticity
        
- Human language: fundamental property of human cognition 
	- Iconicity: Word or sign looks like what it means 
		- E.g. drink in ASL or gulp in English
	- Arbitrariness: Word meaning arbitrary but agreed on 
		- E.g. table
    - Discreteness
    - Productivity
    - Duality of patterning
    - Cultural transmission
    - Learnability
    - Displacement: Referring to events remote in space, time, or reality
    - Prevarication
    - Reflexiveness
- Animal communication:
    - Innate (e.g. barking)
        - One exception, song birds: will still try as communication style is innate but will only come up with broken version for its species
    - Fixed repertoire of signals
    - About here and now
        - One exception is bees: not what if or discussing past events, but can communicate forms of displacement (space)

-   Hockett describes design-feature #5 “total feedback”  
	- “The speaker of a language hears, by total feedback, everything of linguistic relevance in what he himself says”  
	- Important, since it makes possible the so-called internalization of   communicative behavior that constitutes at least a major portion of  “thinking”
- Key feature of language is its ability to represent the world, to say how things are, and to say that they are a certain way even when they are not that way (to misrepresent the world)
- We ask questions, make demands, express emotions, so, language is much more than just a representational system - it's part of a system that generates the ideas that can be communicated in language

### Free Will and Intelligence
- COGS is an interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to understanding and designing systems that think and act intelligently
- Two movements in contemporary western philosophy:  
	- Analytic (English-speaking)  
	- Phenomenological (German/French)
- Challenges:
	- Considerable disagreement even among contemporary analytic philosophers about what philosophy is or should be
		- Metaphilosophy, a journal  
		- Michael Dummett (2001) The Nature and Future of Philosophy  
		- Timothy Williamson (2008) The Philosophy of Philosophy
	- Many scientific disciplines (chemistry, anthropology, ...), unlike Philosophy, have a settled body of knowledge that must be mastered in order to gain entry to the field, as nearly everything is contested
	- Philosophy is the tradition of inquiry and major figures and their works, where we find the disciplinary culture, standards of adequacy, methods, and the sense of what is interesting
	
- Philosophical naturalism
	- Philosophy as a second-order discipline, the study of the various first-order activities of scientists, artists, theologians, jurists 
	- Stages:
		- Before questions are clear enough to apply scientific methods to them (i.e. occurs prior to science)
		- Reflects on the progress of science: questions of meaning (conceptual questions) and justification (methodological questions)
		
- Free Will
	- Traditional
		- Computers can never be intelligent or have agency because they can't act freely (unpredictably), they make decisions based on instructions
			- Even adding a "random" primitive does not mean that the computer is acting freely 
	- Contemporary
		- Consider the difference between “on purpose” and “by accident”
		- Consider the difference between something you do and something that happens to you

### Cognitive Systems
- COGS covers:
	- Natural cognitive systems like humans, other animals, other living organisms, social groups  
	- Artificial cognitive systems like computers, robots, programs, models  
- A system is something like a creature or a mechanism or an organised   network or structure that is distinct from its environment and made up of interrelated and interacting parts
- A system is cognitive if:
	- It can think (process information) and act on what it thinks 
	- Someone (or something) exhibits behaviour that is understandable in terms of what it is thinking.  
- We take an engineering or design perspective on cognitive systems, since our interests include artificial systems
- AI is “fake, artificial” intelligence but not all artificial things are fake
    - Fake artificial - hercamer vs real artificial - lab created diamonds
    - Not all fake things are artificially created (e.g. fool’s gold)
    - Natural artificial – spex wasp (follows algorithm without any adaptability to setting)
- AI’s intelligence can be real artificial intelligence, if achieved

### Intelligence and the Turning Test (1950)
- “Intelligence” varies by perspective – science (gradient), philosophy (all or none)
- Two controversies:
		- Empirical: will there ever be an actual computer that can win the imitation game?  
		- Conceptual: if a computer does win the game, does that mean it can think?
	
- Responses:
	- Turing: says yes to both 
		- Believes that within 50 years, computers will be able to convincingly imitate humans in a game to the point where an interrogator would only have a 70% chance of correctly identifying the machine after 5 minutes
		- Considers the question "Can machines think?" to be meaningless, but predicts that by the end of the century, the concept of machines thinking will be widely accepted due to changes in language and educated opinion
	- Descartes: says no to 1 but yes to 2
		- Two key tests to distinguish a machine from a human: 
			- The machine's inability to arrange words or signs in a manner that effectively expresses human-like thoughts
			- The machine might produce sounds, but it won't be able to respond appropriately to conversation
	- Searle (Chinese Room): says no to 2
		- Seems as though he (as the computer) understands a Chinese language, but he's only obeying a rule book and doesn't realise what he's reading, saying, or even speaking
- There are a variety of positions one can take on the Chinese Room thought experiment:  
	- It fails to demonstrate that AI is impossible (Levesque)  
	- It demonstrates that all forms of AI are impossible (Searle)  
	- It demonstrates that AI is impossible, if one takes the classic “symbols and search” approach: GOFAI
- Supported by Functionalism and Behaviourism 

### The Mind
1. Dualism  
	- Minds (the mental) and bodies (the physical) are distinct from one another, although they are in causal contact
	- Endorsed by many religions 
	- Highlights the fact that:
		- Each of us has special access to the contents of her own mind
		- Mental experiences (thoughts, feelings) exist independent of physical actions or sensory perceptions, suggesting that inner experiences have a direct, stable relationship to external realities
		- Internal aspects of consciousness only required for a full "mental life"
	- Arguments again (Wittgenstein):
		- If everyone has a different "beetle," then the concept of "beetle" loses its meaning as a shared term in language
			- Therefore, if inner experiences are purely subjective and cannot be communicated or compared, then the framework of dualism—where mental states can be treated as distinct entities alongside physical states—becomes problematic
			  
2. Behaviourism  
	- Advocates for a scientific study of the mind that relies on observable behaviour rather than introspection or subjective reports 
	- Considered scientifically valid, as it emphasizes objective and measurable evidence
		- E.g. if someone claims to feel happy, this should be demonstrated through observable actions (like smiling)
	- Endorses the Turing Test as a criterion for determining intelligence, so that if a machine behaves in a way that is functionally equivalent to human behaviour, it can be considered intelligent, regardless of its internal processes
	- Arguments against:
		- Treats mental states (e.g. feelings, introspection) as entirely external, neglecting the internal aspects of the mind 
		- Discrepancy between mental state and outward behaviour
			- E.g. is someone really in pain if they aren't crying?
			  
3. Identity Theory  
	- Advocates that minds are brains, and thoughts are specific physical brain states or processes
		-  E.g. When you touch your hand to a hot stove, your feeling of pain just is firing c-fibers
	- Considered scientifically valid and stands in contrast to dualism
	- Arguments against:
		- Restricts application of "intelligence" to creatures with a brain
		  
4. Functionalism  
	- Advocates that while thoughts and behaviours are distinct, they are inter-connected
	- Intelligence is defined by cognitive functions a system performs, rather than its material composition 
	- Computers exhibit cognitive functions and mental processes similar to brains (e.g. memory, learning, etc)
	- Middle ground between Dualism and Behaviourism, distinguishing thought from behaviour while linking them through observable action
